### The Final Design

With all that I have learned about stability, material strength and height, I realized I had been missing a design all along. The base. With all that I learned from the prototypes, we can make a final, semi-stable, tall tower.

The process of creation is simple. You begin by cutting off a rectuangular section of the lower piece of a sheet of paper. This is done to create the base. This requires a bit of testing as a larger base is more stable, and easier to fold, but a smaller base requires less materials. In my example I went for a larger base.

The folding of the paper is easy. Fold it once in half, then twice to "create" 4 triangles. Then using the diagram below, fold it into the appropriate 3d shape for the base. Ensure you fold over the edge that crosses on the top to secure it in place. You may attempt a binding #2

One you have folded everything accordingly, you may cut the rest of the paper into slices that slowly get smaller and smaller. The more of these you have, the higher it gets, but the less of these you have, the more stable it is. You want a large base one, and increasingly smaller ones, by atleast a cm. You may fold these pieces in half. For refrence I had 3 of these pieces, though I believe one could do more.

With these pieces, grab your largest one, and cut a hole in the base for it to snugly fit in. Ensure you fold each piece (besides the base) at about a 90 degree angle. Then, using a binding #1 methond, attach each piece to eachother. This should then complete the tower. 

This towers should be extremely stable yet reach a large height.
