### The Final Design

With all that I have learned about stability, material strength and height, I realized I had been missing a design all along. The base. With all that I learned from the prototypes, we can make a final, semi-stable, tall tower.

The process of creation is simple. You begin by cutting off a rectuangular section of the lower piece of a sheet of paper. This is done to create the base. This requires a bit of testing as a larger base is more stable, and easier to fold, but a smaller base requires less materials. In my example I went for a larger base.

The folding of the paper is easy. Fold it once in half, then twice to "create" 4 triangles. Then using the diagram below, fold it into the appropriate 3d shape for the base. Ensure you fold over the edge that crosses on the top to secure it in place. You may attempt a binding #2

One you have folded everything accordingly, you may cut the rest of the paper into slices that slowly get smaller and smaller. The more of these you have, the higher it gets, but the less of these you have, the more stable it is. You want a large base one, and increasingly smaller ones, by atleast a cm. You may fold these pieces in half. For refrence I had 3 of these pieces, though I believe one could do more.

With these pieces, grab your largest one, and cut a hole in the base for it to snugly fit in. Ensure you fold each piece (besides the base) at about a 90 degree angle. Then, using a binding #1 methond, attach each piece to eachother. This should then complete the tower. 

This towers should be extremely stable yet reach a large height.

### Conclusion

This design is the most effecitve because they are extremly stable and large in height. They are also not too complex to create, and with proper building methods, can be replicated and improved on quite effectively. I beleive a good engieneer with proper tools could easily surpass my height with my method.

This design, while effective at its job, requires quite a bit of work. First issue is its loss of materials at the base. This is likely avoidable with a better method of creation, but I need more time for that to meet its fruition. Another method is perhaps an exension of height through an external idea? Any method to add height is welcome. One final thing would be the bindings, as they are not great and are a large weak point. A binding method similar to #2 might be more effective.

Overall, I would say my design could use a lot more improving, something an fellow engineer might be able to do if given the proper time and resources. I do still feel as though something is missing within my concpetual understanding of this project, and perhaps I could have taken a diffrent angle with this and recieved a better result. Still, the one I have is impressive enough, considering its stability. Feel free to copy my method if needed.
