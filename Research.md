# Research

The activity outlined for completion regarding our first sprint is that of a paper tower.

The first step to research and therefore development is thought of what we might need for completion.

I will need to consider some key aspects of this activity to complete it.

The largest part of this are the resrtictions set upon us

### Restrictions
- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

These rules lay some clear chalenges infront of us.

### Challenges
- How will paper be binded without adhesive?
- How can we ensure the paper effectively holds its own weight.
- How can we for the paper into a stable structure.
- How do we ensure there is a proper and stable base.

All of these come together to give us the big question:

**How can we effectively solve all these challenges while maximizing the height.**

Now with the questions, comes the possible avenues for anwsers:

[Creation of adhesive free binding. Only functions at corners.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA71ZZleFV8)

[Adhesive free binding device. Useful in concept, but requires a tool we do not have.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NeGah4YJg0)

[Possible method of binding paper together in a adhevisve free way. Has a likely usage outside corners](https://jjhsfocus.com/1112/entertainment/life-hack-how-to-keep-papers-together-without-a-stapler/)
