# Ideation

Now that we have some priniciples to begin designing with, and some challenges to navigate, I believe there is room for personal thought on design. 

First, traingles and circles are golden. Perhaps a tower made of many will be able to navigate the issues this challenge offers.

### Creation of Bindings

To begin we need to know how the paper will go together. A few ideas on this involve diffrent principles found throughout my research.

The first method is simple but valuable. Merely cut two pages and slide the edges together. This is an easy, but flimsy connection.

The next method involves cutting holes and heads to thread through those holes, then folding. This connection is string but requires and wastes a lot of material.

The last method, which is not down here, but was within my research involved "crimping" the paper, to allow for a strong connection at corners. Not too useful consinging the joints of the structure are not bound at corners, but could have uses.

### Creation of Structure

The next step is possible structures for the actual tower. This will likely better be refined in prototyping, but a few baseline designs will help begin the process.

The methods here follow a basic pattern. Repeat a shape, either a triangle, square, or circle, in increaclingly smaller designs, laering them on eachother to achieve height. Like this, they fit easily into eachother, allowing material to be saved in the binding stage. 

### Creation of Base

We also need to consider a base. This is a hard step to concieve without wasting large amounds of material, but a strong base allows for a more efficent structure, saving materials in the long run.

As we see here, a simple but effective base for the triangle based design. Perhaps a square design could be created with more folding. At this current stage, ideation for the base is difficult.
