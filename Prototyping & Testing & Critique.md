# Prototyping & Testing & Critique

Considering how interwoven each of these processes are I have merged them all into a single page. Lets begin with the first design.

### The Triangle

The simplest yet quite effective. While mine did not stand properly, others were quite effective. By chaining these folded strips of paper mirriong them for stability and using the first binding method discussed earlier, we can achieve a (relatively) stable structure, that is efficent in material and height!

It does however lack stability, and due to this I was unable to get a good picture of it standing properly. This is likely due to my folding and cuttign technique ~~but I believe a good design would account for such errors~~. Despite this it was the record holder within our class.

### The Square

Same design as earlier, but with one extra fold. To ask and anwser the question: Does more folds = more strength?

While it would seem adding more sides would add more stability to this design, you would be wrong. This design is equally unstable as The Triangle and even worse, due to the lack of resources, is unable to have a good supporting structure and any reasonable height. Plus a base is hard to make for it. Also due to the the parrelel sides, it makes it hard to use binding #1.

### The Combinded

"What if we put a triangle, **on top of** the square?" - Beric

Well, you certianly get a structure. At least it didn't instantly fall over like the other ones. Could be a possible avenune to explore, if each side didn't require substantially more paper than the previous.

### The Cylinder

Using binding method #2 and rolling the sheets of paper, I attempted to use a method similar to The Triangle but with cylinders. As you can tell from it's crumpled nature, it did not pan out well.

The cylinder was quite effective if given a large amount of paper, but not in the small paper. At a certian size, the paper preffered to fold, over rolling, which quickly caused errors in manufacturing and for the entire structure to fall apart. Not good, and far too difficult to produce.

### The Goofster

Don't even ask me what this is. I was experimenting with a concept that relied on the arches and folds, and binding #2 to create a stable structure. While it does look pretty cool, it did not pan put well.

The central issue with this is a paper circle lacks the rigidity to hold itself up without "jiggling", which qould quickly cause a strucutral collapse. I was able to get about 2 arches in a stable position, but anything after that and it would fall apart.

### The Building

One key concept I relaized was to ensure the centre of mass goes through an actual stable structure. this was the central issue the "The" series had ("The triangle, "The Square", etc.). With this, I decided to make the most stable structure possible. I do not utilize any bindings, and it is basically a extremely stable "The Triangle."

While stable, it lacks height, and is extremly ineffeicent on resources. As I attmepted to experiemnt on maybe adding more elvels to this, I began to run into large conceptual issues, sacrificing stability for height, resulting in strucutal failure. Prehaps there is an idea down this alleyway.
